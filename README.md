# 06-API-Challenge   

This was a two part challenge required knowleged of plotting, APIs and linear regression.

Part 1 - WeatherPy: In the first part of the challenge I used Citipy to randomly select a dataset of over 600 cities and their coordinates.  I then used the Open Weather API to get weather data for each city and put it into a dataframe.  Using the newly acquired data I analyzed the relationship between latitude and other variables (temperature, humidity, cloudiness and wind speed).

Part 2 - VacationPy: Using the dataset from WeatherPy I found the cities with my ideal weather conditions and found the closest hotel. I used hvplots to visualize the data.
